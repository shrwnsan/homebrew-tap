<!-- Project Overview -->
brew-change is a Homebrew utility that displays changelog information for outdated packages with enhanced features like parallel processing, GitHub API integration, and support for multiple package types.

<!-- Development Environment -->
## Development Environment

- **Language**: Bash (Shell Script)
- **Platform**: macOS and Linux (with Homebrew)
- **Testing**: Both local and Docker-based testing environments
- **Dependencies**: bash, curl, jq, git, homebrew

## Setup Commands

```bash
# Clone and set up
git clone https://github.com/shrwnsan/brew-change.git
cd brew-change

# Make executable
chmod +x brew-change

# Test locally
./brew-change --help

# Run comprehensive tests
./tests/test-brew-change-local.sh
```

## Testing

### Local Testing
```bash
# Quick validation
./tests/test-brew-change-local.sh

# Run specific test
./tests/test-brew-change-local.sh
# Choose option 11 for comprehensive test suite
```

### Docker Testing
```bash
# Full Docker test suite
./tests/test-brew-change-docker.sh

# Interactive menu for specific tests
./tests/test-brew-change-docker.sh
# Choose option 3 for interactive menu
```

## Code Style

- **Shell Compatibility**: POSIX bash with modern features
- **Modular Architecture**: Functions separated into library files in `lib/`
- **Error Handling**: Use `set -euo pipefail` for robust error handling
- **Documentation**: Comments for complex logic, especially for API interactions

## Project Structure

    └── brew-change-parallel.sh  # Parallel processing with race condition prevention
```

## Key Features to Understand

1. **Package Type Detection**: Automatically determines if packages are from GitHub, npm, or other sources
2. **Parallel Processing**: Uses background processes with proper synchronization
3. **API Rate Limiting**: Respects GitHub API limits with configurable delays
4. **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
5. **Caching**: Intelligent caching to reduce API calls

## Security Considerations

- **Input Sanitization**: All package names and URLs are validated
- **Network Timeouts**: Configurable timeouts for all network requests
- **No Arbitrary Execution**: Avoids eval/exec with user input
- **API Rate Limits**: Built-in protection against API abuse

## Performance Guidelines

- Use parallel processing for multiple packages (`-a` flag)
- Respect API rate limits between requests
- Cache responses where appropriate
- Handle network failures gracefully with retries

- Code quality and security are verified before merging

## When Making Changes

1. **Test Locally**: Always run `./tests/test-brew-change-local.sh`
2. **Docker Test**: Use `./tests/test-brew-change-docker.sh` for isolated testing
3. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure all required tools are available
4. **Verify Compatibility**: Test on both macOS and Linux if possible
5. **Update Docs**: Keep documentation aligned with code changes

## Common Gotchas

- brew-change must be executable (`chmod +x brew-change`)
- Homebrew must be installed and in PATH
- jq is required for JSON processing
- GitHub API may require authentication for high usage
- Some packages may not have release notes available

## Tools Used
