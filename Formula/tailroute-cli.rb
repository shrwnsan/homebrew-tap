  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      To run tailroute as a daemon:

        sudo brew services start tailroute-cli

      Or manually:

        sudo tailroute daemon

      The SOCKS5 proxy (tailroute-proxy) is available at 127.0.0.1:1055
      when Tailscale and VPN are both active.

      The daemon runs as a root launchd service, so Homebrew takes
      root:admin ownership of this formula's Cellar paths. Upgrades and
      uninstall will prompt for sudo and may need those paths removed
      manually (`sudo brew services stop tailroute-cli` first).

      Browser tunnels (v0.7.0): `tailroute tunnel add <peer>` publishes a
      peer's Tailscale Serve endpoint at https://<peer>.ts.net:<port> with
      TLS verified against the peer's hostname, in any browser, while the
      VPN stays connected. `tunnel open <peer>` opens the URL; status
      reports per-forward health with repair commands.
